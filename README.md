# Image Colorization Project


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The aim of this project is to effectively perform image colorization (i.e. adding colors to black and white images) using deep learning techniques. In this project, we explore different Neural Network architectures to maximize the quality of color prediction on two different datasets, the Mirflickr25k dataset and the Stanford Dogs Dataset.
